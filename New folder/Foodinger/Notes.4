# Props

- props is a short form of Properties so these are the properties which you can pass to these component(js function)
- passing data dynamically we can use props
- Props are just normal arguments to the fuction
- when i say i am passing props to a component that means i am passing argument to a jascript function as simple as that
- example use in vid 4 making restaurant card 





````
const RestaurantCard = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <div className="res-card">
        <img
          src="https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660/jtuqk0cb3lfjldfav46t"

- props is an object and React will wrap all the things like Rname, Cusine... and pass to the components
- Object can be access by . Similarly props can be access by . ex {Props.Rname },{Props.cusine} ...  


# some react developer do "DESTRUCTURING ON THE FLY"

- means:
```
const RestaurantCard = ({Rname , cuisine , ..}) => {..
//instead of {props.Rname}
they write :  {Rname}
<h3>{cusine}</h3>
.}
    
```

but what does this means????
- There is a concept in JavaSCript Destrucuring of object that what really happening behind the scene
```
    const RestaurantCard = (props)=>{
        const {Rname ,cusine} = props;
    }
```
